## 🎨 Design Fidelity

This implementation closely matches the Figma design with:

- **Colors**: Custom purple theme (#4A3F8F) with orange accents (#FFA726)
- **Typography**: Inter font family
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins matching design specs
- **Components**: All sections from the original design
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

## 🔧 Interactive Elements

1. **Mobile Menu Toggle** (Header component)
   - Hamburger icon that transforms to X
   - Smooth slide-down animation
   - Accessible with proper ARIA labels

### Tradeoffs & Shortcuts

1. **GIF**: Although using the GIF was simple, I ran into some minor issues with displaying the GIF that I decided not to deal with for the sake of time.

### With More Time, I May:

1. **Animations**: Add more sophisticated scroll-triggered animations using libraries like GSAP or Framer Motion
