# IntelliToggle Homepage

A creation of the IntelliToggle homepage design built with **Nuxt 3**, **Vue 3**, and **TailwindCSS**.

## Important

- I spent about an hour trying to get pixelay working with the view-only access I have to the figma. Eventually, I had to compromise and copy and paste elements of the design to the pixelay free-trial plug-in page on figma. This approach just had the the pixelay plug-in keep loading and loading without doing anything. Likewise, I tried using the google chrome pixelay extension but it does not work without the plugin in figma. For this reason, I have left just screenshots of my website implementation along with notes on the difference I am sure exist. 
- I fixed a couple of neglected mistakes on the figma like where it says "Join over 1,000+ startups already growing with Untitled."
