# Pixelay Comparison Notes

## Desktop View Differences

1. **Fonts and Sizes**: minor differences in fonts and sizes
2. **Background**: I didn't include the background image for the section before the footer.
3. **Spacing**: Minor differences may exist in exact pixel spacing between sections. Overall layout structure matches the design.
4. **Github logo**: used the wrong color, easy fix though
5. **Company logo**: appears slightly truncated on its left side in the header and footer

## Mobile View Differences

1. **Images**: I improved the view so that there is no cutoff from the right side and the user can see everything clearly. 
2. **Dynamic 'Hamburger' Nav Bar**: Helpful ddition to figma design 
3. **Breakpoints**: Using standard Tailwind breakpoints (768px for md, 1024px for lg) which differ from exact Figma design breakpoints.

-> Note: I did not know if the first media position should be a png or a gif. I left it as a png because it looked better but supplied the gif as well in public/images so you can easily switch them out.
