# Pixelay Comparison Notes

## Desktop View Differences

1. **Fonts**: Using Inter font from Google Fonts. The original design may use custom font weights or slightly different sizing.

2. **Assets**: Logo placeholders used instead of actual company logos (Vercel, Webflow, Stripe, GitLab, Linear). Dashboard screenshots are CSS mockups rather than actual images.

3. **Spacing**: Minor differences may exist in exact pixel spacing between sections. Overall layout structure matches the design.

## Mobile View Differences

1. **Images**: Same as desktop - using placeholders for logos and CSS mockups for dashboard views.

2. **Font Rendering**: May vary slightly depending on device/browser due to system font rendering differences.

3. **Breakpoints**: Using standard Tailwind breakpoints (768px for md, 1024px for lg) which may differ from exact Figma design breakpoints.

## General Notes

- All interactive elements (hover states, mobile menu) are functional
- Color scheme matches design specifications (#4A3F8F primary, #FFA726 accent)
- Component structure is modular and maintainable
- Responsive behavior follows mobile-first principles

## Future Improvements for Pixel-Perfect Match

- Export actual assets from Figma (logos, images, icons)
- Fine-tune spacing using exact px values from Figma design specs
- Match exact font weights and letter spacing
- Add custom breakpoints if Figma uses non-standard sizes
